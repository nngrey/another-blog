This app started as a practice exercise during a free day at Epicodus and evolved into more of a capstone project. It uses Devise for authentication, CanCan for authorization, Paperclip for image uploads, Action Mailer to welcome new users, and Ajax to add and remove comments. Views are built in a combination of html and haml.

You can visit it live, read my thoughts on coding and other matters, and leave your own comments at http://www.nathangrey.me.
